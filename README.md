Created two intelligent agents for a modified game of Backgammon 

To run a generic walkthrough of the game:   
Open the BackgammonWalkthrough jar. You will see the following:

Choose which agents you want to see play against each other by clicking on the corresponding button. After clicking on which agents you would like to see play against each other, the game will start automatically.   

Note:  
-Important - If you click on a game that involves our reinforcement learning agent, it will take some time to learn. This will make the game seem unresponsive for a bit, but eventually once it’s done learning, the game will start automatically. Because we didn’t want the user to wait too long, it is not learning from as many iterations of the game as would be ideal, but if you want, you can change that.   
-Numbers on pieces indicate there are that number of its  pieces above it  

To play against one of our agents yourself:   
Open the Backgammon.jar . You will see the following:

To play, click the button to roll the dice, and then choose a piece to move from. If you choose a piece that can not be moved, you will get a pop up window telling you to choose another piece. The same applies if you choose a piece that will end up landing on the other players stack with more than one piece. Because this move is illegal, you will be prompted to choose another move.   

Note:  
-Like above, if you click on a game that involves our reinforcement learning agent, it will take some time to learn. This will make the game seem unresponsive for a bit, but eventually once it’s done learning, the game will start automatically. Because we didn’t want the user to wait too long, it is not learning from as many iterations of the game as would be ideal, but if you want, you can change that.   
-Once a move is made, you will see a yellow box indicating where you moved from and a blue box indicating where you moved to. The other players move will be made automatically.
